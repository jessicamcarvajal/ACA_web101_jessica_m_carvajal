                <div class ="description">Git is an Open Source Distributed Version Control System. It is a content tracker mostly used to store code. It allows multiple developers to work on a project independently without risk of code conflicts. Code can be stored locally as well as on a server, such as GitHub. GIT can be used to clone all your commits, unlike Subversion which only checks out a single version of the repository.

                    One thing I learned today, is that a doctype tells the browser which version the html markup is written in.
                    
                    The workflow I am learning to take when creating a page is to draw out a wireframe first. This helps outline the html structure. Next, I would create a new repo on git hub and clone to my local. Then, I’d open VS from git and create my html and css files, then start coding. Once I am done coding, I’d then create a pull request to get my files up to git hub where I could share them.
